OpenCloudOS 8.5 is independently developed and designed based on the Linux kernel, and its core capabilities such as stability, security, compatibility and performance have been fully verified for a long time. As a reliable enterprise-level server Linux distribution, users can directly deploy and apply OpenCloudOS 8.5 to production systems, reducing users' system operating costs.

At the end of 2021, the mainstream operating system software CentOS8 in the industry has stopped maintenance, which has caused a large number of users to fall into security risks. The kernel of OpenCloudOS 8.5 can enjoy various new technologies and self-developed optimizations of the community while ensuring enterprise-level stability. The basic libraries and user-mode components are fully compatible with CentOS8. Through kernel-level optimizations and enhancements, OpenCloudOS 8.5 can provide users with better solutions than CentOS8.

It is understood that OpenCloudOS 8.5 has been running stably for more than 2 years in real business scenarios such as social networking, gaming, financial payment, AI, security, and big data. It has undergone long-term verification of tens of millions of nodes, and its availability is as high as 99.999%. Compared with CentOS7 and other open source community versions, OpenCloudOS 8.5 has a failure rate of more than 70% lower, and its performance is improved by more than 50% in typical business scenarios.

The current OpenCloudOS 8.5 version adopts an automatic and simple installation method that automatically partitions, formats, and installs the default software package. By default, the graphical environment is not installed. Compared with the traditional installation method, the operation is simpler and the process is faster. Users can also manually install on demand, which can meet the general needs of most server scenarios.

OpenCloudOS, an open source operating system community initiated by Tencent and its partners, is a completely neutral, fully open, secure, stable, and high-performance operating system and ecosystem. At the beginning of its establishment, OpenCloudOS decided to become a completely open and neutral open source community, and has confirmed the acceptance of community project donations through the TOC review of the Open Atom Open Source Foundation. Under the trust and supervision of the foundation, OpenCloudOS will operate in a standard open source community model, and will be co-governed and built with community participating units.

OpenCloudOS has accumulated the advantages of many manufacturers in software and open source ecology, and inherited Tencent's more than 10 years of technical accumulation at the operating system and kernel level. It has solid support in cloud native, stability, performance, hardware support, etc., and can be equal Full support for all hardware platforms.

As one of the main initiators of the OpenCloudOS community, Tencent has developed its own server operating system TencentOS Server since 2010 based on the feature requirements, performance requirements and security requirements of its own business and based on massive business scenarios. In 2019, Tencent officially open sourced the TencentOS kernel.

With the official release of OpenCloudOS 8.5, OpenCloudOS will also provide stable and high-availability services for enterprises in more industries and application scenarios to meet the demanding workload requirements of the business.
